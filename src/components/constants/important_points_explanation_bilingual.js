// constant file referred to as 'model'; record refers to backend records flat, profile, user
// fieldset for inputs takes absolute positioning
// fieldset form-group-document, takes params.top, params.left, params.width
// Anything iside params objects needs to be in snake case eg input_type for use in rails api
// !!!! Only height needs to be px NOT %; however, textarea height works with %
// !!!add required: true for validation at submit
// !!! when there is a boolean params.val, there needs to be an initial value of true of false,
// otherwise, first click on false will not work since there is no value in document choices
// can make params.val boolean a string but need to make consistent for all
